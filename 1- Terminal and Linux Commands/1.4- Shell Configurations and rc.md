### 1.4- Shell Configurations and rc
different types of shells are introduced in **the handwritten lecture pdf** please refer to it for more details, these types are
-   **Non-Interactive Shells**
Non-interactive shells are intended for executing scripts or batch processes without direct interaction or involvement of a user.

-   **Interactive Login Shell**
An interactive login shell is typically the first shell session you get when logging into your system directly from a console login prompt or via SSH. Itâ€™s called a login shell because you must authenticate (log in) to start the session.

-   **Interactive Non-Login Shell**
An interactive, non-login shell is a shell you get when you open a terminal application in a graphical user interface or start a new shell instance from an existing shell session

Login interactive Shell :

non Login interactive Shell :

non interactive shell:

#### 1.4.2- Testing Shell rc files flow
rc-file stands for run command file, this is a file is executed once the shell session starts based on type of the starting shell.
this command file acts as configuration for the shell, below is a diagram for which rc file to start and its location.

![output](https://i.stack.imgur.com/WFliw.png)

**I:  executing non login shell with custom --rcfile \<file>** 
1- create a custom rc script with name **custom_script.sh**

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Hello from custom rc file"

this script prints "Hello from custom rc file" on running

2- execute non login shell with custom configuration different than the default one

    ziad@ziadpc:~/Desktop$ /bin/bash --rcfile custom_script.sh 
this command will start new bash and runs custom_script.sh initially.
**expected :** on running this bash  "Hello from custom rc file" and reset the colors to its default

3- the result
![output](https://i.ibb.co/yqmgBR3/Screenshot-from-2024-04-09-14-30-23.png)as shown, ls in the first line shows the result in a colored form and other information. these configuration are written into ~/.bashrc file.
but in the new shell (the second command) on executing the same **ls command** the output is set to the default.


**II:  checking the order of execution of interactive login shell**

1- rename /etc/profile to check if this file is executed by shell on startup or no

    ziad@ziadpc:/etc$ mv profile profilee

expected is to lose the default configurations in the profile file
 
 2- rename (~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.bashrc) to check if this file is executed by shell on startup or no, in my Ubuntu i have only ~/.bashrc

    mv .bashrc .bashrcc
**expected :** on running interactive login shell no styling or any configurations are executed.

3- running interactive login shell by using ssh

 - install open-ssh client
```
ziad@ziadpc:/etc$ sudo apt install openssh-client
```
 - start login shell
```
ziad@ziadpc:~/Desktop$ ssh ziad@localhost
```
![output for bash](https://i.ibb.co/5TrsxVs/Screenshot-from-2024-04-09-14-58-55.png)as expected, no styling is shown. now undo our changes and test if styling will exists or no in login-shell

4- redo changes

    ziad@ziadpc:~$ sudo mv /etc/profilee /etc/profile
    ziad@ziadpc:~$ mv ~/.bashrcc ~/.bashrc

now run ssh command again
![output of interactive login shell](https://i.ibb.co/NWbW89Q/Screenshot-from-2024-04-09-15-02-25.png)
as expected the default configurations are exists 

**III:  you can test the flow by adding, modifying, or deleting rc files **

#### 1.4.3- Editing some configuration in rc files
in this section we will edit the shell as follows:

 - in interactive non-user login shell (e.g. gnome-terminal) we will replace the `ziad@ziadpc:~$` line before any command with any text for example `====`
 - in interactive login-user shell we will keep this line `ziad@ziadpc:~$`
 
this section exploit configuring configuration files by modifying some files.
**hint: refer to the flow-chart and perform the task before reading the steps**

**1- editing the non-login interactive shell**

we will consider modifying /etc/bash.bashrc file and we will replace the `ziad@ziadpc:~$` with some text for example `====` .
the configurations of this gui terminal exists in `/etc/bash.bashrc` file
1- open /etc/bash.bashrc file with any text-editor, I choose Vim

    ziad@ziadpc:~$ vim ~/.bashrc 

2- locate this block
```
# set a fancy prompt (non-color, overwrite the one in /etc/profile)
# but only if not SUDOing and have SUDO_PS1 set; then assume smart user.
if ! [ -n "${SUDO_USER}" -a -n "${SUDO_PS1}" ]; then
        PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '
fi

```
3- comment the variable PS1 and write the following:
```
# set a fancy prompt (non-color, overwrite the one in /etc/profile)
# but only if not SUDOing and have SUDO_PS1 set; then assume smart user.
if ! [ -n "${SUDO_USER}" -a -n "${SUDO_PS1}" ]; then
        PS1='===='
        #PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '
fi
```

4- the PS1 variable is overridden by ~/.bashrc so we will rename this file
```
mv ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrcc
```
 
4- save and open new gnome-terminal

![the result](https://i.ibb.co/PhHhVRs/Screenshot-from-2024-04-09-15-16-17.png)
after opening a new terminal we see our result.

**2- editing the login interactive shell**
1- we will consider .profile file to edit

    ziad@ziadpc:$ sudo vim /etc/profile

2- from .bashrc file we notice that this line `PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '` is responsible for showing `username@hostname`, so we will copy it and paste it in the end of the /etc/profile file
```
 # /etc/profile: system-wide .profile file for the Bourne shell (sh(1))
# and Bourne compatible shells (bash(1), ksh(1), ash(1), ...).


if [ "${PS1-}" ]; then
  if [ "${BASH-}" ] && [ "$BASH" != "/bin/sh" ]; then
    # The file bash.bashrc already sets the default PS1.
    # PS1='\h:\w\$ '
    if [ -f /etc/bash.bashrc ]; then
      . /etc/bash.bashrc
    fi
  else
    if [ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ]; then
      PS1='# '
    else
      PS1='$ '
    fi
  fi
fi

if [ -d /etc/profile.d ]; then
  for i in /etc/profile.d/*.sh; do
    if [ -r $i ]; then
      . $i
    fi
  done
  unset i
fi

PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '
```

3- try to open interactive login shell via ssh
