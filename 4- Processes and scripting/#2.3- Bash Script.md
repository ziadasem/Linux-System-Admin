### 2.3 Bash Script

#### 1- Variables
**Note**: comments is after `#`

*define* a variable:
```bash
<var name>=<value>
```
no spaces around the `=` sign

*to reference* a variable, use `$` before the variable name:
for example:`echo $var_name` 

*to clear* a variable use
```bash
unset <var_name>
```

**Complete example**: 

```bash
#!/bin/bash
var1=Hello
var2="Hello there"
var3="Hello World!"

echo $var1 $var2 var3 #Hello Hello there var3, because we didn't reference var3 correctly

echo $var3

#to clear the variables

unset var1 var2 var3

echo $var1 $var2 $var3 #no value because they are cleared
```

```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
var1 Hello there var3
Hello World!
```

**assign variables equal to another variables**

```bash 
var1="Hello"
var2=$var1
echo $var1
```

```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
Hello
```

**Using variables inside a string**

```bash
var1="Ziad"
var2="Hello ${var1}, please enter your password"
echo $var2
```

```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
Hello Ziad, please enter your password
```

**Using output results inside a string**

```bash
var1="Hello from $(pwd), please enter your name"
echo $var1
```
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script
Hello from /home/ziad/sysadmin_playground, please enter your name
```

**Lists**
```bash
LIST_NAME=(VAL1 VAL2 VAL3)

echo ${LIST_NAME[0]}
```

example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
NAMES=('ziad' 'assem' 'zeyad')
echo ${NAMES[1]}
```

```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
assem
```


**Variable naming conventions**
In Bash scripting, the following are the variable naming conventions:
1.  Variable names should start with a letter or an underscore (`_`).
2.  Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`).
3.  Variable names are case-sensitive.
4.  Variable names should not contain spaces or special characters.
5.  Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the variable.
6.  Avoid using reserved keywords, such as `if`, `then`, `else`, `fi`, and so on as variable names.

#### 2-  Input and output
bash script can read from:
1. user prompt
2. arguments passed to the script
3. file

**user prompt:**
```bash
#bash_script
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, please enter your name"
read username

echo "Thanks ${username}"
```


```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
Hello, please enter your name
ziad
Thanks ziad
```

**arguments passed to the script:**

In a bash script or function, `$i` denotes the `ith` argument passed, for example`$2` denotes the second argument passed.

`$#` denotes number of passed arguments

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "number of passed arugments is $#"
echo "first argument is $1"
echo "second argument is $2"
echo "third argument is $3"
echo "fourth argument is $4"
```
arguments are separated by spaces for example, `my name` is two arguments not one argument, to make it single argument use the '' or ""
```
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script "first argument" "second" third argument fourth argument
number of passed arguments is 6
first argument is first argument
second argument is second
third argument is third
fourth argument is argument
```


**read from a file:**
we can read line by line or the full content as a single line.

read the full content as a single line:
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ cat input 
Hello
this
is
a 
file
```

```bash
file_content=$(<"file_path")
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
file_content=$(<"input")
echo $file_content
```

```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
Hello this is a file
```

reading line by line is achieved by using loops, so it will be discussed in the loops section.

bash script can output to:
1. screen using `echo`
2. to file using the append operator `>>` or the overwrite operator `>`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, please enter yourname"
read username

date>last_login_date.txt

echo "${username} logged into the system at $(date)" >> logs.txt
echo "logged"                
```
**Note the string interpolation** 
`var1="this is string interpolation ${var_name}, $(command name)"`

```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
Hello, please enter yourname
Ziad
logged
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ cat logs.txt 
Ziad logged into the system at Thu 18 Apr 22:34:55 EET 2024
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ cat last_login_date.txt 
Thu 18 Apr 22:34:55 EET 2024
```
append and overwrite:
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
Hello, please enter yourname
ziad2
logged
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ cat logs.txt 
Ziad logged into the system at Thu 18 Apr 22:34:55 EET 2024
ziad2 logged into the system at Thu 18 Apr 22:35:31 EET 2024
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ cat last_login_date.txt 
Thu 18 Apr 22:35:31 EET 2024
```

#### 3-  Statements 
3.1- **Conditional Statements**

**If-Condition** 
```bash
if [[ condition ]];
then
	statement
elif [[ condition ]]; then
	statement 
else
	do this by default
fi
```
**if statement**

 - starts with **if** and ends with **fi**
 - consists from if, elif, and else

**Conditions**:
conditionals assess the value of a command, (i.e. its exit status), and check if this value is equal to 0 then it will evaluate the true branch, else it will go to the elif block or else block according to the if-block.
 for example:
```bash
if pwd; then
	echo "true"
else
	echo "false"
fi
```

```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
/home/ziad/sysadmin_playground
true
```

is `pwd` command has a value? 
**YES**, every process when it finish its execution it returns an exit status values when it terminates normally or abnormally. this exit status value can be used to indicates whether the command was successfully executed or failed. For example, if tar command is unsuccessful, it returns a code which tells the shell script to send an e-mail to sysadmins or If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns a status of 127. If a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126.

we will make the script returns an exit status in next sections.

to mimic Boolean evaluations,  a specialized commands should be used. There are three ways to test an expression in Bash:

 - **`test`** command; it tests the command's exit status
 - **`[ ]`** the shorthand for `test` command
 - **`[[ ]]`** the imporved version of `[]`

**test:**
test the expression and evaluate it, if it true it will terminate and return with exit status = 0 (which is evaluate the true branch), else if it is false it will exit with exit status =1 (not equal one, which evaluate the elif or else branch).
to get the exit status of the last value use `$?`
for example:
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ [ 3 -eq 3 ]
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ echo $?
0
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ [ 3 -eq 5 ]
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ echo $?
1
```

**[ ]:**
shorthand for test
`[ + space + condition + space + ]`
 
 **[[ ]]:**
`[ 3 > 5]`it will not perform logical comparison, but it will perform creation of a new file with name `5` (see section of input and output) and will exit without any errors (i.e. exit code = 0) so it will evaluate with true.
 the `[[ ]]` is an improved version of it to avoid this cavities as it will evaluate `[[ 3 > 5 ]]` as a logical expression.
 
 for example:
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ cat bash_script 
#!/bin/bash

if test 3 > 6; then
	echo "creation of file is true"
else
	echo "will not be executed since the statment is not a comparsion statement"
fi
ls

if [ 5 > 5 ]; then
	 echo "creation of file is true"
else
	echo "will not be executed since the statment is not a comparsion statement"
fi
ls

if [[ 5 > 7 ]]; then
	echo "true"
else
	echo " false without creating a new file called 7"
fi
ls

```

```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
creation of file is true
6  bash_script
creation of file is true
5  6  bash_script
 false without creating a new file called 7
5  6  bash_script
```

to avoid this issue, use `[[ ]]`, or use the following operators and flags
**Conditions operators and flags**:

 -   `-eq` : Checks if two numbers are equal
 -   `-ne` : Checks if two numbers are not equal
 -   `-gt` : Checks if the first number is greater than the second number
 -   `-lt` : Checks if the first number is less than the second number
 -   `-ge` : Checks if the first number is greater than or equal to the second number
 -   `-le` : Checks if the first number is less than or equal to the second number
 -   `-a` : and
 -  `-o` : or
 -  `[[ -z STRING ]]` Empty string
 - `[[ -n STRING ]]`Not empty string
 - `[[ STRING == STRING ]]`Equal
 - `[[ NUM -lt NUM ]]`Less than
 - `[[ NUM -le NUM ]]`Less than or equal
 - `[[ NUM -gt NUM ]]` Greater than
 - `[[ NUM -ge NUM ]]`Greater than or equal
 - `[[ STRING =~ STRING ]]`Regexp
 - `(( NUM < NUM ))`Numeric conditions

**File conditions**

 - `[[ -e FILE ]]`Exists
 - `[[ -r FILE ]]` Readable
 - `[[ -h FILE ]]` Symlink
 - `[[ -d FILE ]]`Directory
 - `[[ -w FILE ]]`Writable
 - `[[ -s FILE ]]` Size is > 0 bytes
 - `[[ -f FILE ]]`File
 - `[[ -x FILE ]]`Executable
 - `[[ FILE1 -nt FILE2 ]]`1 is more recent than 2 (newer than)
 - `[[ FILE1 -ot FILE2 ]]`2 is more recent than 1 (older than)
 - `[[ FILE1 -ef FILE2 ]]`Same files

**Comparing multiple statements:**
```bash
num1=7
num2=12
num3=9

if [ "$num1" -ge "$num2" ] && [ "$num1" -ge "$num3" ]; then
    echo "$num1 is the largest number"
elif [ "$num2" -ge "$num1" ] && [ "$num2" -ge "$num3" ]; then
    echo "$num2 is the largest number"
else
    echo "$num3 is the largest number"
fi

```

 **Case statement**
 
 ```bash
case expression in
    pattern1)
        # code to execute if expression matches pattern1
        ;;
    pattern2)
        # code to execute if expression matches pattern2
        ;;
    pattern3)
        # code to execute if expression matches pattern3
        ;;
    *)
        # code to execute if none of the above patterns match expression
        ;;
esac
```

**case statement**

 - starts with case and ends with esac (reverse of case)
 - matches pattern in this form \<pattern\>**)**
 - every statement or block is terminated by `;;` sign
 - the asterisk sign `*` in patterns indicates \<all patterns>, which means it will match anything, it is similar to default keyword in c-like languages switch case statements

3.2- **Loops Statements**

3.2.1- **For Loop** 
```bash
for var_name in {sequence of values}; do
#statements
done;
```
starts with `do` and ends with `done`

```
`for` `VARIABLE` `in` `1 2 3 4 5 .. N`
`do`
`command1`
`command2`
`commandN`
`done`
```

```
`for` `VARIABLE` `in` `file1 file2 file3`
`do`
`command1 on $VARIABLE`
`command2`
`commandN`
`done`
```

```
`for` `OUTPUT` `in` `$(Linux-Or-Unix-Command-Here)`
`do`
`command1 on $OUTPUT`
`command2 on $OUTPUT`
`commandN`
`done`
```

for example:
```bash
for i in {1..5}
do
    echo $i
done
```

**Sequence of numbers**:
{\<start>..\<end>[..\<step>]}
`{1..10..2}`
or use command `seq`
`seq <start> <step> <end>`

**C-Like For-Loop**
```bash
for (( initializer; condition; step ))
do
shell_COMMANDS
done
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# set counter 'c' to 1 and condition 
# c is less than or equal to 5
for (( c=1; c<=5; c++ ))
do 
   echo "Welcome $c times"
done
```
**Loop on List**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
NAMES=('ziad' 'assem' 'zeyad')
for name_element in ${NAMES[@]}; do
	echo $name_element
done;
```
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
ziad
assem
zeyad
```

3.2.2- **While Loop** 
```bash
while [[ $i -le 10 ]] ; do
   echo "$i"
  (( i += 1 ))
done
```

#### 4-  Functions in  bash
like functions in programming languages, it accepts input arguments and returns a value. definition of input parameters and using of return values is a bit different in syntax than C-Like languages  

**body**

two versions of defining a function
```bash
function_name () {
  commands
}
```
or 
```bash
function function_name {
  commands
}
``` 

for defining a function in a single line, use `;` after every command on the single line.
for example, for the first version:
`function_name () { commands; }`
for the second version
`function function_name { commands; }`

Notes:

 - in scripting language, defining a function before call it
 - defining a function isn't an execution to it
 - When using single line “compacted” functions, a semicolon `;` must follow the **last** command in the function

```bash
#!/bin/bash

function func1() {
	echo "Hello from function 1"
}

function func2(){
	echo "Hello from function 2"
}
function func3(){
	echo "Hello from function 3"
}
#calling a function 
func2
func1
```

```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
Hello from function 2
Hello from function 1
```

as expected, defining a function isn't executing it. 

**Parameters**
```bash
function func1() {
	echo "argument one is $1"
	echo "argument two is $2"
	echo "number of passed arguments $#"
}
```
same method of accessing script passed parameter, but the scope here is limited to this function only.

**passing arguments to the function:**
call the function in any line of the script and pass the arguments after writing the function name.
```bash
function func1() {
        echo "argument one is $1"
        echo "argument two is $2"
        echo "number of passed arguments $#"
}       
func1 arg1 arrgg22 some_args args args                 
```

the complete example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

function func1() {
        echo "argument one is $1"
        echo "argument two is $2"
        echo "number of passed arguments $#"
}       

echo "script's first argument is $1"
func1 arg1 arrgg22 some_args args args
```

```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script scrp_arg
script's first argument is scrp_arg
argument one is arg1
argument two is arrgg22
number of passed arguments 5
```

**return from a function:**
to get the value from a function, use the `$?` command which get the exit value of the last command (or functions)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
function fun2(){
	return 8
}
fun2
echo $?
```

```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
8
```
#### 5-  Exit from Script
exit statues can indicates an when it terminates normally or abnormally. for example you can use value of exit status in the shell script to display an error message or run commands or to check the status of command.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
exit 5
```
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ echo $?
5
```

#### 6-  Automation and Scheduling of  bash execution using Corn
One of the challenges (among the many advantages) of being a sysadmin is running tasks when you'd rather be sleeping. For example, some tasks (including regularly recurring tasks) need to run overnight or on weekends, when no one is expected to be using computer resources. 

two service utilities allow  to run commands, programs, and tasks at predetermined times. The [**cron**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) and **at** services enable sysadmins to schedule tasks to run at a specific time in the future. The at service specifies a one-time task that runs at a certain time.

**cron**
cron (from Chronos, the Greek word for time) is a daemon to execute scheduled commands.

**cron can be used for:**
 - regular updates
 - running an early every morning that creates a new "message of the day" (MOTD) on each computer. It contains information, such as disk usage, that should be current in order to be useful.
 - perform regular backups or database migration
 - any other task need to be automated and scheduled

cron functionality depends on:
 - **crond** daemon service
 - files in **/var/spool/cron** and **/etc/cron.d** and the **anacrontab** file, which are the defining files for what to be executed
 - **crontab** utility to add and edit the cron jobs
 -  **anacron** program that performs the same function as crond, but it adds the ability to run jobs that were skipped,

every user on the system has his own jobs, a user can view his jobs by using `crontab -l`
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~$ crontab -l
no crontab for ziad
```

**Adding cron jobs**
every user has its own cron file in cron tables directory `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/`, These files don't exist by default a user can create it manually or use `crontab -e` to create and edit it (which is preferred)

 ```bash
 ziad@ziadpc:~/ crontab -e
 ```

```
# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
# 
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
# 
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
# 
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command
```

to add a job:
```
# Example of job definition:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  * user-name  command to be executed
```


|  Schedule | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
