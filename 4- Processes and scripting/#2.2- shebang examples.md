### 2.2 Shebang
Bash scripts start with a `shebang`. Shebang is a combination of `bash #` and `bang !` followed by the bash shell path.

in this md, some working examples that test different states and conditions about setting the shebang

**1- Interpreting bash script with shebang**

`ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ vim bash_script`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Bash Script"
```
<br>

1- **Case 1**: execute the script by the bash program without execute permission.

```bash
#remove the executing access
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ chmod u-x bash_script 
```
**with bash**
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ /bin/bash bash_script 
Bash Script
```

**with python**
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ /bin/python3 bash_script 
  File "/home/ziad/sysadmin_playground/bash_script", line 3
    echo "Bash Script"
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playgroun
```
syntax error because python tries to interpret a file with an expected python syntax, but it found an unknown syntax to it (bash script).


**Implicit execution**
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
bash: ./bash_script: Permission denied
```

2- **Case 2**: execute the script by the python program without execute permission.
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ vim python_script
```

```python
#!/bin/python3
print("Hello from python")
```
**with bash**
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ /bin/bash python_script 
python_script: line 3: syntax error near unexpected token `"Hello from python"'
python_script: line 3: `print("Hello from python")'
```
syntax error because bash tries to interpret a file with an expected bash syntax, but it found an unknown syntax to it (python script).

**with python**
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ /bin/python3 python_script 
Hello from python
```

**Implicit Execution**
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./python_script 
bash: ./python_script: Permission denied
```

3- **Case 3**: execute the script implicitly.

Give execution permission:
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ chmod u+x python_script bash_script 
```
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./python_script 
Hello from python
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
Bash Script
```

the shebang directed the specified interpreter to execute its file, but what if we didn't use the shebang term.

4- **Case 4**: execute the scripts without shebang to check the default interpreter.

```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ cat bash_script 
echo "Bash Script"
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ cat python_script 
print("Hello from python")
```
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
Bash Script
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./python_script 
./python_script: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `"Hello from python"'
./python_script: line 1: `print("Hello from python")'
```
it is clear that the default interpreter (if missing) is the **bash**.

5- **Case 5**: execute the scripts with shebang set to wrong interpreter path.

```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ cat bash_script 
#!/bin/python3
echo "Bash Script"
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ cat python_script 
#!/bin/bash
print("Hello from python")
```
**Implicit execution:**
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./bash_script 
  File "/home/ziad/sysadmin_playground/./bash_script", line 2
    echo "Bash Script"
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ ./python_script 
./python_script: line 2: syntax error near unexpected token `"Hello from python"'
./python_script: line 2: `print("Hello from python")'
```
explicit execution by the shebang operator resulted in interpreter error, use explicit execution to solve this issue.
 
```bash
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ /bin/python3 python_script
Hello from python
ziad@ziadpc:~/sysadmin_playground$ /bin/bash bash_script 
Bash Script
```
