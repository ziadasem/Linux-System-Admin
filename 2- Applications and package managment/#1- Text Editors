## Text Editors 
### 1- Nano
**GNU nano** is a text editor for Unix-like computing systems or operating environments using a command line interface. It emulates the Pico text editor, part of the Pine email client, and also provides additional functionalities such as: opening multiple files, scrolling per line, undo/redo, syntax coloring, line numbering, and soft-wrapping overlong lines.

refer to man page of nano by
```
man nano
```
or from [here](https://nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.1.html)

### 2- Vi
 The vi editor is one of the most common text editors on Unix. It was developed starting around 1976 by Bill Joy at UCB, who was tired of the ed editor. But since he used ed as a code base, access to the original sources has required a commercial Unix Source Code License for more than twenty years. In January 2002, Caldera was so kind to remove usage restrictions to the Ancient Unix Code by a BSD-style license (see the announcement at Slashdot) and thus vi is now finally free.

Compared to most of its many clones, the traditional vi is a rather small program (the binary size is approximately 160 kBytes on i386) just with its extremely powerful editing interface, but lacking fancy features like multiple undo, multiple screens, or syntax highlighting.

This port of vi has generally preserved the original style, terminal control, and feature set. It adds support for international character sets, including multibyte encodings such as UTF-8, and some minor enhancements that were not present in BSD vi 3.7, but had been included in later vi versions for System V or in POSIX.2. 

The name "vi" is derived from the shortest unambiguous abbreviation for the ex command visual, which switches the ex line editor to its full-screen mode.

we will use Vi and Vim because they **almost exists in** all Linux distribution 

### 3- Vi Improved (Vim)
Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. **It is included as "vi" with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X.**  
Vim is often called a "programmer's editor," and so useful for programming that many consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, though. Vim is perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing configuration files.
  
Vim is rock stable and is continuously being developed to become even better. Among its features are:

-   persistent, multi-level undo tree
-   extensive plugin system
-   support for hundreds of programming languages and file formats
-   powerful search and replace
-   integrates with many tools

**Vim, is an enhanced, improved, and extended version of the Vi text editor**.  Vim builds upon the foundation of Vi while adding numerous features and improvements. It is a more feature-rich and upgraded version of the Vi editor

#### 3.2- Using Vi/Vim
vim has two modes:

 1. Insert mode
 Where you can just type like normal text editor. (Press i for insert mode)
  2. Command mode
   Where you give commands to the editor to get things done like copy, delete, undo, ..etc,  Press ESC for command mode

below is a diagram for some of basic commands and states in the command mode.

another commands:
-   / backward search n to find the next occurrence and N to search in opposite direction
-   ? forward search

### 4- gedit
gedit is a full-featured **GUI** text editor for the GNOME desktop environment. You can use it to prepare simple notes and documents, or you can use some of its advanced features, making it your own software development environment.


you can find other text-editors but the common one is Vi/Vim
